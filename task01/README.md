## Before Doing Assignment

If you have not done the [task0](../task01), do it first to set up the C++ graphics developtment environment.

Follow [this document](../doc/submit.md) to submit the assignment, In a nutshell, before doing the assignment,  
- make sure you synchronized the `main ` branch of your local repository  to that of remote repository.
- make sure you created branch `task01` from `main` branch.
- make sure you are currently in the `task01` branch (use `git branch -a` command).

Now you are ready to go!
